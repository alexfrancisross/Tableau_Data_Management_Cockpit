This Repo Contains The Source Code For The Tableau Data Management Cockpit (credit to @Darren McGurran)

The Tableau Data Management Cockpit provides enhanced admin views and data sources that are based on the Tableau Catalog Metadata API. The solution uses Python to mine Tableau and External assets in the Catalog and generates a .hyper file with each of these assets in separate tables:

There is an accompanying workbook called `Data Management Content vx.x.twb` which provides a template for how these tables can be related to generate a data source with the upstream and downstream assets:
